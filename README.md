## Problem Description:

A typical Regression Machine Learning project leverages historical data to predict insights into the future. This problem statement is aimed at predicting Life Expectancy rate of a country given various features.

Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time a human being is expected to live, Life expectancy depends on various factors: Regional variations, Economic Circumstances, Sex Differences, Mental Illnesses, Physical Illnesses, Education, Year of their birth and other demographic factors. This problem statement provides a way to predict average life expectancy of people living in a country when various factors such as year, GDP, education, alcohol intake of people in the country, expenditure on healthcare system and some specific disease related deaths that happened in the country are given.

### Discussion :
Using Machine Learning I have explain and predict the life expectancy of different countries depending on various factors such as year, GDP, education, alcohol intake of people in the country, expenditure on healthcare system and some specific disease related deaths and many other factors of the countries.

Here I have created Two models. The Algorithms have been used to test if they can provide good prediction with less erros while predicting the life expectancy for new data.
The Model Algorithms have been used are:

* Linear Regression
* Random Forest

**On Compairing Both the Models, we came to this conclusion that Random Forest Model is giving us less error and best Prediction score in compare to Linear Regression Model**

### Best Model Deatils:

    
|| Random Forest Model|
|:-------------------------------------|--------:|
| Prediction score        |  0.959 |
| Mean absolute error(MAE)|  1.209 |
| Mean Square Error (MSE) |  3.782 |
| Quadratic mean (RMSE)   |  1.944 |
